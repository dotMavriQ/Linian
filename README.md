# Linian

> **Linear Integration for Obsidian**

Convert Linear issue shortcodes like `[TEAM-465]` into clickable links with status-based styling in your Obsidian notes.

## üôè **Inspiration & Acknowledgments**

Linian is inspired by the excellent **[Jira Issue](https://github.com/marc0l92/obsidian-jira-issue)** plugin for Obsidian created by **[marc0l92](https://github.com/marc0l92)**. We aimed to create a spiritual cousin that brings the same seamless issue integration experience to Linear users. Special thanks to marc0l92 for pioneering this workflow in the Obsidian ecosystem - their work showed us how powerful inline issue references can be for note-taking and project management.

Our goal was to match that same level of functionality and user experience, but tailored specifically for Linear's modern issue tracking approach.

## API Usage

Linian uses the Linear GraphQL API. Make sure your API key has the following permissions:
- Read issues
- Read teams
- Read users (for assignee information)

## Troubleshooting

### Issues Not Loading
1. Verify your API key is correct
2. Check your internet connection
3. Test the connection in settings
4. Clear the cache and try again

### Slow Performance
1. Reduce cache timeout
2. Decrease max cache size
3. Disable avatars if not needed

- Ensure shortcodes follow the pattern `[TEAM-123]` (or `[L_TEAM-123]` for the expanded view)
- Team keys must be uppercase
- Issue numbers must be numeric

## Privacy & Security

- API keys are stored locally in your Obsidian vault
- Issue data is cached temporarily to improve performance
- No data is sent to third-party services except Linear's API
- All connections use HTTPS
